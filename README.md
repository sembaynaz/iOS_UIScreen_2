## Project Description
The iOS_UIScreen_2 project about how design project in UIKit without storyboard and any libraries. The technoligies that used:
TableView (header, footer),SstackView, UILabel, UIButton, Constraints, TabBar. 

I demonstrate in photos run this project in iPhone 14 pro and iPhone SE

## Installation
No secondary libraries were used here, only **UIKit**. You can download the project from GitHub as a zip file and then open it in the **xCode** application. (No additional installations are required)

## Usage
On this project you can see three screens that are all connected via TabBarController. The **generateTabBar()** function adds view controllers to the tab bar and immediately edit their images, which will be displayed in the tab bar and the names. The function **setTabBarAppearance()** - configures the tabbar itself, if you look I added a line, selected images of tab bar are black.

Also you can see from the 3 screens I added the design to only one (this is the first screen). Here you can learn how to add a custom cell, add it to your tableView. 
You can see how to add header and footer to the tableView inside the **configureTableView()** function inside the MainViewController file.

All used photos are added to assets. The font family Inter was used for the text.
